## Things Learned, ML

 1. `~`: unary minus (distinct from `-` for subtraction operator)
 1. In REPL, must `use` program first and only then `use` the test suite for it.
 1. Test functions involve two `=` signs: e.g., `val test2 = double 0 = 0`.
 1. Comments are noted with `(* ... *)`.
 1. "Semantics" includes type-checking and evaluation.
 1. "static" vs. "dynamic" environments.
 1. ' Every value “evaluates to itself” in “zero steps”. '
 1. `()` has type `unit`.
