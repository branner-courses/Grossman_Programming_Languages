## Things Learned, ML

 1. Lecture 2-8

   * three questions to ask about a data-type: 
     * syntax, 
     * evaluation, 
     * type-checking

   * value: something that is done evaluating

   * `div`: division operator
   * `mod`: modulus operator

   * `pr`: pair: 2-tuple
   * field: 
   * list
   * `#`: indexing operator. `#1 e`: expression 1 of pair `e`
   * `*`: operator dividing types in type-checking expression
 

```
fun <name> (<arguments>) =
    return value
```


 1. Early material
   * `~`: unary minus (distinct from `-` for subtraction operator)
   * In REPL, must `use` program first and only then `use` the test suite for i t.
   * Test functions involve two `=` signs: e.g., `val test2 = double 0 = 0`.
   * Comments are noted with `(* ... *)`.
   * "Semantics" includes type-checking and evaluation.
   * "static" vs. "dynamic" environments.
   * ' Every value “evaluates to itself” in “zero steps”. '
   * `()` has type `unit`.
